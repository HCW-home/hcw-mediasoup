## Define random key here
JWT_SECRET=aadsrwerrf

## Configure credentials used to consume mediasoup API
API_USER=abcd
API_SECRET=1234

## Define here the public IP server
PUBLIC_IP=1.2.3.4

## If server is behind nat, you might need to advertise 
# the real public IP by commenting out this line.
;ANNOUNCED_IP=1.2.3.4

## You will need to open UDP port in the follow range, you

;RTC_MIN_PORT=40000
;RTC_MAX_PORT=49000

## If this server is behind a reverse proxy, you might need to trust it
TRUST_PROXY=1.2.3.4

# this API to serve directly HTTPS, you might need to configure the
# following lines
;HTTP_ONLY=true
